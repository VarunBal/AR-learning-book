# AR-learning-book

In this project the aim is to increase the level of interactivity of books to
enable a greater learning and illustration opportunities, by developing an
augmented environment in which the objects can be manipulated and
interacted with for a greater user experience.

This is achieved by using the marker-based tracking technology using
vuforia in unity game engine. Different markers are associated with
different objects and characters to display them on top of the physical
world. The user can then interact with them by manipulating the objects
with operations like zooming, panning, rotation etc. and can even play
animations.
